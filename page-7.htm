            "The folktale of Paruhang and Sumnima: Kirat God and Goddess."</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Long ago, in the distant past, Paruhang, the god of the sky, was wandering the earth in search of a worthy partner. He had heard of a beautiful goddess named Sumnima, who was said to reside in the mountains. </p>
        <p class="post-text">Paruhang set out to find Sumnima, and after many days of traveling, he finally reached the mountains. He saw Sumnima from afar, and he was immediately smitten by her beauty.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Sumnima, however, was not easily won over. She was a strong and independent goddess, and she was not interested in marrying just anyone. She decided to test Paruhang's worthiness by setting him three challenges.</p>
            
            <p class="post-text">Sumnima's first challenge was for Paruhang to bring her <span class="sub-heading-2">a crystal clear water </span> from the deepest part of the ocean. Second challenge: to bring her <span class="sub-heading-2">a feather from the wing of the highest-flying bird.</span> And the final challenge for him: to bring her <span class="sub-heading-2">a spark from the heart of the volcano.</span> </p>

        
        <p class="post-text">Paruhang accepted the above challenges and set out to complete it. He traveled to the ocean and dove deep into it's depths, he traveled to the highest mountains and waited for the highest flying bird to pass by, and he traveled to the volcano and bravely ventured into its heart. He managed to retrieve everything and bring it to Sumnima. Sumnima was deeply impressed by Paruhang's bravery and determination. She realized that he was a worthy partner and agreed to marry him.</p>
        
        <p class="post-text">Paruhang and Sumnima had five sons, each born in a different form. Their sons were: <span class="sub-heading-2"> 1. Khembalung:</span> The tiger son, born with the strength and bravery of a tiger. </p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">2. Mabo Hang: </span>The bear son, born with the wisdom and cunning of a bear.</p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">3. Hem Khambu: </span>The human son, born with the intelligence and leadership of a human.</p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">4. Kukur: </span>The dog son, born with the loyalty and devotion of a dog.</p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">5. Saanje Bhir: </span> The lion son, born with the courage and pride of a lion.</p>

        <img src="images/image37.jpg" alt="" class="alt-img">

        <p class="post-text">Paruhang and Sumnima loved all their sons equally, but they knew that each son had unique gifts and abilities. They decided to test their sons to see who would be the most responsible and worthy of their blessings.</p>
            
            <p class="post-text">Paruhang and Sumnima gave each of their sons a task. They told Khembalung to guard the forest, Mabo Hang to protect the mountains, Hem Khambu to cultivate the land, Kukur to watch over the village, and Saanje Bhir to roam the plains.
                The five sons worked hard to complete their tasks.
                </p>
            <p class="post-text">Paruhang and Sumnima returned to see how their sons had done. They were pleased to see that all of them had worked hard and completed their tasks. But they were especially proud of Hem Khambu, the human son, who had cultivated the land with such care and diligence.</p>
            <p class="post-text">Paruhang and Sumnima decided to bless their sons with special gifts. They gave Khembalung the power of strength and bravery. They gave Mabo Hang the power of wisdom and cunning. They gave Hem Khambu the power of intelligence and leadership. They gave Kukur the power of loyalty and devotion. And they gave Saanje Bhir the power of courage and pride.</p>
            <p class="post-text">The five sons were grateful for their parents' blessings. They promised to use their gifts wisely and to always protect and care for one another.</p>
            <p class="post-text">As Paruhang and Sumnima grew old, they decided it was time to pass on the throne to one of their sons. After careful consideration, they decided to give the throne to Hem Khambu, the human son, due to his intelligence, leadership, and kindness.</p>
            <p class="post-text">Hem Khambu was crowned the new king, and he ruled with wisdom and justice. His brothers stood by his side, using their unique gifts to help him govern the kingdom.</p>
            <p class="post-text">The story of Paruhang and Sumnima teaches us about the importance of love, family, and responsibility. It reminds us that each person has unique gifts and abilities, and that we should always strive to use our talents wisely.</p>
            <p class="post-text">The folktale of Paruhang, Sumnima, and her sons beautifully illustrates that every family member possesses unique abilities and strengths, which, when valued and nurtured, bring happiness, harmony, and prosperity to the family and society.</p>
            <p class="post-text">The Kirat people believe that they are the descendants of Paruhang and Sumnima's five sons and that they have a sacred responsibility to honor their ancestors and preserve their cultural heritage.</p>
            <p class="post-text">These values continue to play a vital role in shaping the identity and community of the Kirat people, promoting a deep connection with nature and a strong sense of family and traditions.</p>
