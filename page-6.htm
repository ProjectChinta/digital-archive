            "Harmony in Heritage: Exploring the Varied Clans OF RAI (KHAMBUS) Community"</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Nepali proverbs such as “Jati Rai tyeti kura” (as many Rais, as many dialects)
            and “Dus Rai, Das Bhasa: Ek chula” (many Rais and many languages, but one hearth)
            reflect the internal diversity of the Khambu Rai group. This diversity is most evident in
            their clan structure, languages, customs, and traditons. </p>
        <p class="post-text">Khambus are not a single group but a collection of many tribes or clans (called thar),
            and each clan is further divided into smaller groups like pachha (lineage) and samait
            (class). Their culture and social structure are mostly the same, but different
            subgroups have some noticeable differences</p>
        <p class="post-text">New clans can be formed for many reasons, like moving to a new place or marrying
            into another clan. Because of this, it is very hard to make a complete and final list of
            all the Khambu clans. Different researchers have given different numbers over time.
            For example:</p>
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">Makhalung-</span>Campbell (1840) and Hodgson (1858) listed 28 clans.</p>
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">Makhalung-</span>Sir Herbert Risley (1891/1981) counted about 57 clans.</p>
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">Makhalung-</span>Vansittart (1896) found 45 clans.</p>
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">Makhalung-</span>John Morris (1933/1993) mentioned 73 clans, including the Yakkha.</p>
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">Makhalung-</span>KiraƟ Khambu Rai Sanskritik Sansthan (KKRSS) in 2004 menƟoned 37 clans.</p>
           
            <p class="post-text">So, the number of Khambu clans is sƟll debated, and no one agrees on an exact number </p>


        <h2 class="sub-heading">"THAR"</h2>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-2">"Thar"</span>means a <span class="sub-heading-2">clan or family group</span> hat comes from the same ancestor in the
            past. It is an important part of the Khambu Rai community and helps organize how
            people live, marry, and follow tradiƟons. People from the same thar believe they are
            from the same family line, even if they don’t know all the details. Members of the
            same thar are considered to be relaƟves and are not allowed to marry each other,
            following the rule of clan exogamy (marrying outside one’s own clan). </p>

        

        <p class="post-text">While the exact number of thars can vary due to historical developments and
            regional differences, some of the more prominent and widely recognized thars within
            the Khambu Rai community include:</p>
            
            <p class="post-text">Bantawa</p>
            <p class="post-text">Chamling</p>

            <p class="post-text">Mugali</p>
            <p class="post-text">Dungmali</p>
            <p class="post-text">Chhintang</p>
            <p class="post-text">Wambulay/Ambulay</p>
            <p class="post-text">Athpahariya</p>
            <p class="post-text">Tsukwa/Pohing</p>
            <p class="post-text">Bunglawa</p>
            
        <h2 class="sub-heading">"PACHA"</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In the Rai community, people are divided into large family groups called Thars,
            and each Thar is further divided into smaller family groups called Pachas. In Bantawa
            Rai language, PAPA means Father and CHA means Son (PA= Father and CHA= Son).
            When combined, Pacha represents the family line that is passed down from father to
            son, then to grandson, great-grandson, and so on for many generations. This <span class="sub-heading-2">Pacha system</span> works like a family title or bloodline and helps track the genetic connection
            within the Rai community. Because of this, two people who have the same Pacha are
            not allowed to marry. This is because they share the same ancestors and family
            blood, which means they are closely related. In Rai tradition, the Pacha and Samet
            are seen as the same as DNA or genes in the blood. Marrying someone with the same
            Pacha can lead to inbreeding, which may cause serious health problems such as:
            Birth defects, Miscarriages, Stillbirths, Infant deaths, Stunted growth, shorter life
            expectancy. So it is important to enquire Thar, Pacha and Samet of bride and
            bridegroom before marriage. Also, it is very important to know family history
            background up to seven generaƟons from male side and up to three generaƟons
            from female side for various purposes in Rai traditions and customs.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">"SAMET"</h2>
            <p class="post-text">In the Rai tribe, along with Thar (clan) and Pacha (family line), there is another
                important part of their social and cultural system called Samet. <span class="sub-heading-2">Samet</span> shows a
                person’s blood connection to their first ancestor, also called their original ancestor or
                proto-ancestor. <span class="sub-heading-2">SAMET</span> is further divided into two types: <span class="sub-heading-2">Hongchi Samet</span> and <span class="sub-heading-2">Sichi Samet</span>. <span class="sub-heading-2">Hongchi Samet</span> refers to the Samet of living people, both male and female,
                and is commonly used in everyday life and important ceremonies like weddings. On
                the other hand, <span class="sub-heading-2">Sichi Samet</span> belongs to those who have passed away and is especially
                used during rituals that honour ancestors, such as Mang Sewa, and during funerals.
                The <span class="sub-heading-2">Sichi Samet</span> of the deceased is used to call upon the ancestral spirits and guide
                the soul of the person who has died. The ritual helps the soul join the world of the
                ancestors, where it finds peace and conƟnues with the souls of earlier family
                members.</p>
