            "The Rai Shamans Who Act as
Custodians of the Culture and
History of a Community."</h2>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Abstract :</span>This paper tries to examine the importance of Rai
Shamans popularly known as “Bijuwas”in the Rai community
through research and interview. The interview was
conducted with Mr. Mohan Rai who is a Sili Mangpa residing
in Lebong, Darjeeling . The paper deals with the origin, role
and contemporary position of Bijuwas in modern society. It
aims at providing an understanding of the importance of
Bijuwas and how they preserve the culture, identity and
history of the Rai community. </p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Introduction :</span>The paper is an aim to investigate into the shamans of the
Rai community known as the “Bjjuwas”. It traces the origins
of the Rai people and how the Bjjuwas play a vital role in
keeping the culture, traditions and practices of the
community alive. It inspects the historical and cultural
importance of the Bijjuwas and also throws light on their
contemporary position in society. </p>
        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Methodology :</span>This research adopts a qualitative/quantitative approach
using primary sources from articles like “Functions of
Nachhung (Shaman) in the Chamling Rai in Eastern Nepal”
by Rai Pushpa Raj . Oral narratives were also combined
which was collected through interview highlighting the
different aspects of the Rai shamans contributing greatly to
my research.
The prime limitation to this reserach was the scarcity of
written sources on the history and culture of the Rai people. </p>
            
            <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Who are the Rai People?</span>Historically there are no concrete evidences of the exact
origin of the Rai community. With the help of folklores and
researches historians conclude that the Rai people belonged
to the 'Kirat Desh”. The dynasty is believed to have been
located in modern Nepal which was then divided into “Wallo
Kirat" ,"Mahja Kirat" and "Palo Kirat" which mean near Kirat,
middle Kirat and far Kirat respectively. The term ‘Kirati" is an
umbrella term which encompasses the different ethnic
groups which resided in the Eastern Himalayas like "Limbu”,
"Yakkha" and "Sunuwar” . Rai is one from these different
ethnic groups which have various similarities but also have
their own unique culture, religion,festivals and language.
However, the term Rai is also an umbrella term for the
different types of Rais that are divided for different reasons.
The different tribes that Rai people belong to is known as a
"Thar".</p>
<img src="images/image63.png" alt="" class="alt-img">
        
        <p class="post-text">The “Thar' of a Rai is a result of different circumstances like
their "Paccha’(lineage) ,their "Samait' (class) and other
reasons like migration or marriage. There aredifferent “Thars”
like "Chamling’,"Bantawa’,"Khaling’,’Atphariya”and "Wambule"
but they all consider themselves as Rai nonetheless.
Sometimes the word "Khambu”is also used alternately in
place of Rai. This is because it is believed that due to their
bravery and marshal qualities the Rais were often appointed
as chiefs or commanders in the army of king Prithivinarayan
Shah. Hence, the "Khambu"which translates into "chief" or
"headman" is also often alternately used in place of Rai.</p>

        <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">The Rai Religion :</span>The Rai’s religion is heavily based on the worship of nature
and ancestors. The elements of animism and manism can
be heavily traced in their religious beliefs and practices. </p>


                <p class="post-text">According to the Rai "Mundum” (heritage) which is passed
down from one generation to the other in the form of “Tuturi
Beth' (oral tradition) the Rai believe in the worship of the
different forces of nature like the "Henkama" (earth),
"Minaaama” (sky) and "Sohun”(river). The Rai also believe in
"Sumnima-Paruhang"as the supreme dieties of the entire
Kirati community where "Sumnima" is believed to be the
Goddess of Earth and “Paruhang”the God of sky.</p>
                <p class="post-text">TUnlike the major religions the religious and spiritual
teachings of the Rai community is not readily available and
preserved largely through oral traditions. Like the many
minority communities the survival of the beliefs, stories and
traditions of this community is largely dependent on oral
tales and rituals performed by Shamans.</p>

                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">A Brief Introduction to Shamanism :</span>Shamanism does not have a single definition that has been
unanimously been agreed upon. Different social historians
have traced the etymology of the word to different sources of
origin. Mircea Eliade states that shamanism may been
derived from the Sanskrit word "sramana" which was used to
designate spiritual monks in India. Other historians believe
that the term may have been adopted from the Tungusic
language of Siberia "sadman”connected to Tungusic word “sg”
which means "to know". Anthropologist and archaeologist
Silvia Tomaskova argues that the word shaman was used to
refer to the non-Christian indeginous people of the Ural
mountains by the Europenas.</p>
                <p class="post-text">While there seem to be no exact definition of shamanism
English historian Ronald Hulton has pointed out four
characteristics of a shaman which seem to be similar in all
ethnicities. Firstly, he states that a shaman is "anybody who
contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of
consciousness”. Secondly , that they are people who can
contact the spiritual world. Thirdly, they are people who act
as "healers’ or "witch doctors" and lastly, that that
shamanism is mostly associated with Asia. </p>
                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Who are Rai Shamans?</span>The Rai Shamans are often clubbed together as Bijuwas.
However, they have different names according to their tribes
and jobs. The term Bijjuwais a Nepali term which evolved
homogenising the entire different Shamans into one group
and replaced them as the modern franca lingua. </p>
<img src="images/image59.png" alt="" class="alt-img">

                <p class="post-text">It is believed that the Rai Shamans did not originally exist in
the way that they do today. The Rai folklore tells the tale that
the Kirati community may have originated after the marriage
of “Hechakuwa'or “Hechakuppa” and “Nalungma’(river
goddess). When both of them fell ill “Nalungma” requested
Hechakuwa to become a Bjjuwa.</p>
                <p class="post-text">“It was an age of supernatural powers, he was able to do
that due to it being the satya-yug (an era of truth). | believe
Hechakuwa to be the first Bijuwa. He is our father figure. He
started the entire culture of celebrating festivals and the
1
worship of the ‘chula dunga'" ( a place of worship where
three stones are places each representing 'Hechakuwa),
‘Nalungma'and the supernatural forces of nature) -Mohan
Rai(Sili Mangpa)</p>
                <p class="post-text">Today in the modern society it is believed that boys and girls
receive a “calling” from the “chula dunga” These youngsters
have to take up a guru usually a “Mangpa”and learn all about
the Rai folklore knows as “Sili”. After the master the “sili”they
become Bijuwas.</p>
                <p class="post-text">The Bijuwas are heavily embedded in the day to day life of
the Rai community. They are the ones who are required when
a child is born to a Rai household or when there is a death.
Festivals are celebrated with the rituals, songs and dances
that they perform. They are an irreplaceable existence who
are deeply involved in the cultural practices of the Rai people:</p>
                <p class="post-text">1.In Birth : After a baby is born in a household there is a
ceremony known as “Chumbukli” (the removal of the amical
cord). It is celebrated after 5 or 7 days depending upon the
gender of the baby. It is the Bjjuwa who welcomes the baby
into the family and then only the grandmother names them.
The Bijuwa is responsible for performing the “Nungwakma”
or submitting the child to the “samka"”(chula dunga).</p>
                <p class="post-text">2.During Festivals: A section of the Bijuwasknown as the
“Mavi Hang” are responsible for performing the puja of the
"kool'( place where the ancestors reside i.e, the Chula
dunga). During festivals like “Sakhela” or “Sakhewa”they
perform rituals which honor the “Henkama” (Earth), the
“Minaama”( Sky) , the “Sohun”( River) and “Nayukhman”
(Serpent).</p>
                <p class="post-text">A "Mavi Hang"|s someone who does not perform “chinta’{ a
practice where the Bijuwas help the soul of the departed rest
peacefully). “A ‘Mavi Hang’ doesn't involve themselves in
helping the soul of the departed, especially, if it is an
unnatural death. They are not powerful enough to do that”
-Mohan Rai.</p>
                <p class="post-text">3.As Healers: The Kirati community who resided in the
mountains did not have access to hospitals as such. It was
the Bijuwas who prepared medicines from natural resources
and medicinal plants to heal people. Modern technology and
medicine have to a large extent replaced the Bijuwas,
however , during emergencies and in rural areas people still
turn to Bijuwas are immediate relief.</p>
                <p class="post-text">4.Dance and Music: “Sili Mangpa”or the “teacher of dance”
is another type of Bijjuwas who teaches the traditional dance
and songs. They are Bijuwas who master the knowledge of
the different dances, songs and folklores and pass it down to
the younger generation.</p>
<img src="images/image60.png" alt="" class="alt-img">

                <p class="post-text">5.In Death: Bijuwas known as the “Mangpa”or “Nachung”are
the ones who are responsible for guiding the soul of the
departed. They perform “chinta”and help the souls of the
departed to rest in peace. In cases of untimely and unnatural
deaths like death by suicide or an accidents the “Mangpa”
gives these souls residence in the different parts of the
house like the garden or the threshold.</p>
                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Female Bijuwas :</span>Female Bijuwas are known as “Mangma”. It is believed that
they flourished in the earlier years but have decreased during
the modern period. The Rai community which does not have
strict gender rules is believed to have the equal number of
male and female Bijuwas.</p>
<img src="images/image61.png" alt="" class="alt-img">

                <p class="post-text">“The same amount of boys and girls receive their callings but
women show reluctance due to the changing times,
especially due to the difficulty of not being able to travel
whenever and wherever when required”.- Mohan Rai.</p>
                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">The Importance of Bijuwas :</span>“In the Rai community we need Bijuwas because we do not
worship Gods or idols as such. Ours is a culture where we
worship our ancestors with the help of folklore passed down
to us by the Bijuwas”™ Mohan Rai.</p>
                <p class="post-text">The “Mundum’ heritage) is passed down from one Bijuwa to
another from their “guru” in the form of “Tuturi Beth'( oral
tradition”. This “Mundum”which includes all the folklores
about the origin of the Kirati community , their
festivals,rituals,cultures and their songs and dances is what
keeps the community alive. Like the many minority
communities the survival of the beliefs, stories and traditions
of this community is largely dependent on oral tales and
rituals performed by the Bijuwas becomes the only historical
evidence that the Rai community can fall back to.</p>
                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">The Position of Bijuwas in Contemporary Modern Society :</span>Though Bijuwas are still respected in the contemporary
society there is a decrease in youngsters who would want to
take up this path. One from the many reasons is the decline
in oral traditions. Oral traditions where Bjjuwas would tell
youngsters about the different folklores no longer exists.
Another reason is attributed to scientific modernisation.</p>
<img src="images/image62.png" alt="" class="alt-img">

                <p class="post-text">“Even if the children receive their callings to become a Bijuwa
they do not accept it because they are embarrassed to
accept it due to modernisation”. -Mohan Rai.</p>
                <p class="post-text">The Rai community still heavily depends upon the Bijjuwasto
perform various rituals and rites. The practice of "Chinta”
when there is a death in a family or while celebrating
festivals Bijuwas are still sought after. While there is a
decrease in the passing down of the "Mundum”due to
modernisation the position of the Bijuwas still remains as a
respectable one.</p>
                <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Conclusion :</span>Bijuwas play an importance role in preserving and passing
down the “Mundum”of the Rai community . They are an
indispensable part of the community for they keep the belief
systems and culture of the Rai community intact and alive.
The loss of Bjjuwas would result in the grave loss of the Rai
heritage.</p>
