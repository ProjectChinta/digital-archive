        <p class="post-text">Symbol of connection with nature and spirit animals.
Often associated with forest spirits and used by the shaman (bijuwa or mangpa) to channel
animal energy during trance.
They may also serve as totemic items, invoking the guidance or protection of ancestral animal
spirits—especially deer, a sacred animal in many indigenous Himalayan traditions.</p>

        <p class="post-text">Represent the physical vessel of life and are a conduit to the spirit world.

            "RICE WINE OR JAR:"</h2>
            <p class="post-text">Offering to Ancestors and Deities:</span></p>
            <p class="post-text"></span>In rituals like Chinta, marriages, or birth celebrations, rice wine is offered to the Suptulung
            (three sacred stones) and ancestral spirits. Pouring rice wine on the ground or near sacred sites is a way to honor and invite ancestral
            presence</p>

            <p class="post-text">Medium for Communication:</span></p>
            <p class="post-text">Shamans (mangpa or bijuwa) often consume rice wine before entering trance states, believing it
            opens spiritual channels to communicate with spirits or diagnose illnesses. Purification and Blessing: It is sprinkled or offered as part of cleansing rituals, especially during death rites, to purify the
            space and guide the soul.</p>
            <p class="post-text">It’s traditionally served during festivals (like Sakela) and gatherings, bringing people together.</p>


             <h2 class="sub-heading">
            "CHULADHUNGA OR SAMKHALUNG / SUPTULUNG"</h2>
                        <p class="post-text">Chuladhunga,</span> a sacred triangle of three stones nestled in a space known as the Samkhalung
or ChulakothaThe designations and functions of the three stones differ across.Rai clans,</span>particularly based on the Pachha</span>(lineage or sub-clan). For the Bantawa clan, the hearth stones
are referred to as:</p>

            <p class="post-text">Makhalung-</span>Symbolizing the spirits of female deceased members and, in certain situations,
called on for women who are still alive in rituals.</p>

          <p class="post-text">Pakhalung-</span>Left for the spirits of deceased male members and called upon in rituals relating to
living males.</p>

 <p class="post-text">.Ramilung-</span>Linked with guardian spirits or lost souls, called upon to guard and protect the
family.However, some clans of the Rai community also regard Ramilung as a stone that
symbolizes the 'Hunters', reflecting the belief that the Rai people were originally hunters.”The
Chuladhunga occupies a key position in significant life-cycle ceremonies and religious rituals.
Rituals like Pitripuja involve the presentation of offerings where traditional products like rice,
millet, wheat, tongba (millet beer), and flowers are presented around the hearth. The offerings
are used to appease the ancestors, receive blessings, and ensure balance between the world of
spirits and the home.
Prior to and subsequent to important events in life—such as birth, marriage, and death—the
Chuladhunga is ritually invoked.</p>

    <p class="post-text">Balam – “The Soul Medium in Chinta"</span></p>
    <p class="post-text">This is Balam, a sacred assemblage of nine-layered leaves — kaulo (local avacado), katush
(chestnut ) , titepati (mugwort ) and amliso (Nepalese broom ) l— tied and hung upright, facing
downward. Deeply symbolic and integral to the Chinta death ritual, it acts as a spiritual medium
to capture wandering or fragmented souls — whether from living beings struck by trauma or
from the realm of the departed. Often referred to as sato putlo ureko, this structure embodies
the shamanic belief in soul retrieval and protection. During the ritual, the shaman invokes,
contains, and ultimately restores the soul to its rightful place. Balam is not just foliage — it is a
lifeline between the visible and the unseen.</p>

    <p class="post-text">"The Sacred Attire of a Mangpa – Dancer Between Worlds”</span></p>
    <p class="post-text">Clad in symbolism and ancestral memory, the Mangpa or Shaman wears the sacred Sayabung
— a powerful headdress adorned with dumsi ko kara/ (porcupine quills), feathers of the
cock, the majestic baaz (eagle), and the kalij bird — connecting sky, earth, and spirit.</p>
 
<p class="post-text">Wrapped in red or yellow feta, representing the teen chula dhunga (three sacred hearth
stones), the Sayabung crowns the shaman’s role as mediator between realms.</p>

<p class="post-text">Draped in a white jama (frock) — a symbol of purity and transformation — and rhythmically
ringing ghantis (bells) tied outward to match the sacred steps of the Mundhum chants, the
shaman calls in spirits, ancestors, and energies.</p>

<p class="post-text">He carries the traditional Nanja, a handwoven Rai bag holding ritual objects: akcheta (sacred
grains), aduwa (ginger), and dumsi ko kara, echoing the tools of healing and summoning.</p>

<p class="post-text">Around his neck, long malas of rudraksha and snake bones serve as protectors and powerful
totems, embodying spiritual resilience and ancestral strength.</p>

<p class="post-text">This is not just clothing — it is sacred armor, worn in rhythm with the spirit world.</p>

    <p class="post-text">Tools of the Spirit Walker – "Rudraksha, Bells, and Serpent Bones"</span></p>

  <p class="post-text">This image showcases three sacred items carried by the Mangpa (Shaman), each holding deep
ancestral and spiritual significance</p>

    <p class="post-text">Rudraksha Mala –</span> These natural seed beads are worn for spiritual strength and protection.
They aid in grounding the shaman’s energy and enhancing focus during ritual chants and trance
work.</p>


    <p class="post-text">Ghantis (Bells) – </span>  Attached to the shaman's garments, these bells resonate with every
movement, aligning with the rhythm of the Mundhum chants. Their sound is believed to call
spirits, cleanse the space, and guide the energy of the ritual.</p>

    <p class="post-text">Snake Bones –  </span>   Often worn as long necklaces, these bones symbolize transformation, ancient
earth wisdom, and the cycle of life and death. They act as protective totems and are revered for
their connection to primal energy.</p>


    <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Labha Taneko – "Sucking Out the Malice"</span></p>

    <p class="post-text">In this photograph, the Mangpa (Shaman) is captured in the sacred act of Labha taneko — the
intense ritual of drawing out negative, malicious energies from the home during Ghar Chinta.
Through deep chants and trance, the shaman sucks the harmful spiritual residue, which is
believed to sometimes manifest as khoon (blood) — a symbolic representation of the darkness
being removed.</p>

  <p class="post-text">This moment reflects a powerful intersection of body, spirit, and ancestral duty — where the
shaman becomes both healer and vessel, cleansing the space and restoring spiritual harmony.</p>

 <p class="post-text"><span class="sub-heading-3">Khoon of Labha – The Manifestation of Malice</span></p>

    <p class="post-text">This image captures the raw aftermath of Labha taneko — the sacred act where the Mangpa
(Shaman) extracts deep-rooted negativity or harmful spirits from a person or space.</p>
